/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict role-based access model where the website's content
 * is publicly readable by everyone, but can only be managed by a designated set of administrators.
 * This supports an "app store" or portfolio-style website where anonymous users can browse content,
 * and authenticated admins can use a panel to manage that content.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /apps/{appId}: A top-level collection containing all public application data.
 * - /roles_admin/{userId}: A private collection that grants admin privileges. If a user's UID exists
 *   as a document ID in this collection, they are considered an admin.
 * - /developer_profiles/{userId}: Stores the public profile for a user. Only the authenticated owner can write to their own profile.
 * - /website_settings/global: A singleton document for publicly readable website configuration.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public Read-Only Default: Data in /apps, /developer_profiles, and /website_settings is publicly readable to ensure the
 *   website is functional for all visitors.
 * - Admin-Only Writes for Core Content: Write operations for /apps and /website_settings are restricted
 *   to users with an admin role.
 * - User-Owned Profile Writes: Authenticated users can only write to their own document in the /developer_profiles collection.
 * - Admin Role Management: The /roles_admin collection is secured so that only
 *   existing admins can manage its documents, preventing unauthorized self-promotion to admin status.
